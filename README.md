Prototype of a Shared Storage Library for ActivityStream
========================================================

This repo is a place for us to hack on the first deliverable described in the
[Activity Stream Prototype Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g3OzUc38V-t4EXkO9MUOJ4_TmCqSsz9IJPGh0fCcIgg/edit#heading=h.9tlc3jth8qok)
document.  We aim to produce a shared rust library that can be used in Desktop
Firefox, Fennec, and Firefox for iOS, in order to prove out the developer experience
and ergonomics of this potential future approach to code sharing.
